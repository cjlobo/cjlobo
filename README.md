ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cejana Maciel, and I am a Certified Scrum Master and proven Business Analyst with over 10 years of experience, including extensive work in leading technical teams using Agile and Scrum. I am looking to flex my talents to identify new growth strategies and trends as a Junior Data Analyst.  I've always been fascinated by numbers and the investigation of problems. And working in data analytics has been a long-term goal of mine.  My career as a Business Analyst / Scrum Master has taught me to think strategically about problems and identify solutions.
